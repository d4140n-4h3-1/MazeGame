//! Makes the maze's surfaces visible from both sides.
//!
//! The maze pieces are tubes that are meant to be walked through, but their faces do not agree on
//! which way is "in": some point into the corridor and some out. The renderer culls faces seen
//! from behind, so those walls and ceilings vanish from inside. Every triangle therefore gets a
//! reversed twin with flipped normals - each side then has a front face with its own, correct
//! normal, so it is both drawn and lit properly whichever side it is seen from.
